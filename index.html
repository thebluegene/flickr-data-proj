          For 8 years now I've shared my photography on Flickr, and after gaining an interest in data visualization, I realized
          posting photos to Flickr has been creating a database of all my work. It made perfect sense to use that data of over 1600
          photos for my first D3 project. There were three questions I wanted to answer with the visualizations:
          <ul>
            <li>
              How apparent is the difference in my photography style during my four attempts at a 365 project?
            </li>
            <li>
              When do I take the most photos?
            </li>
            <li>
              What are my most used settings?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="post-container--text">
          I break up my photography growth into four eras of increased output -- each era coinciding with an attempt at a 365 photo-a-day project (I only made it all the way through the year on my final attempt).
          To address the first question, I used an npm package to get the most vibrant color of an image, get-image-colors, to assign each photo with a dominant color, because I was curious if I could
          see any discenerable difference in the colors of my photostream. There isn't really -- though it makes for a colorful visualisation. I do believe, however,
          there are significant differences in style, subject, and composition between sets when photos from each are viewed and compared.

         To address the second question, I counted how many photos I took at various time intervals. Most of the photos are from when I was still in school, so 
         the fact I took most of my photos from 3PM to 11PM and on the weekend make sense. My monthly counts are a bit more random, likely event-driven (vacation, portrait session, etc.).

        <p class="post-container--text">
         Lastly, I counted photos based on all the EXIF data collected on my account. Not a whole lot of surprises -- I really like shooting wide open and the nifty 50 
         pretty much lives on my camera. I do find it interesting that my ISO settings gravitate towards native ISOs, as it's not something I actively think about when 
         setting up exposure.

              I have taken over 600 photos with manual lenses (24mm f/2.8, 35mm f/1.7, 135 f/2.8) that don't track lens specific EXIF data, like aperture and focal length, and those are not reflected in the data.
